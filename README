This is my personal code repository, which primarily contains my solutions to some algorithm problems I solved.
Please do not copy and paste my solutions if you happen to be stuck on those algorithm problems.

My coding style when solving an algorithm problem is drastically different from when writing an actual application. Maintainability and reusability is not my primary goal when coding up a solution to an algorithm problem, especially during a timed contest.
