There is a N * N matrix. At first you are at the upper left corner (0,0) and you want to get to the lower right corner (N - 1, N - 1). You can only walk down and right.

Futhermore, you can not pass the main diagonal. This means that you can only walk in the upper half or lower half of the matrix (including the diagonal).

Please calcuate How many ways can you get to the end point?

Input

The test case contains only one interger N. (1 <= N <= 2000)

Output

Output the number of the number of ways you can get to the lower right corner without passing the diagonal in a single line. Since the result may be very large, just output the remainder of the answer divided by 10007 please.

Sample Input

4

Sample Output

10
