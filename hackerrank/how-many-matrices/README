How many ways can use integers from 1 to n to make a matrix, such that in each row from left to right the numbers are increasing and in each column from top to bottom the numbers are also increasing.

For example If n = 4 there are 4 such matrices. Namely

(1)

   1 2 3 4
(2)

   1 2
   3 4
(3)

   1 3
   2 4
(4)

    1
    2
    3
    4
Input

Only one interger N in a single line(1 <= N <= 109).

Output

The number of matrices in a single line. Since the result can be very large, output the remainder of it divied by 10007.

Sample Input

4

Sample Output

4
