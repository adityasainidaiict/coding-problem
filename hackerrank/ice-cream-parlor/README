Sunny and Johnny together have C dollars which they intend to use at the ice cream parlour. Among L flavors available, they have to choose two flavors whose cost equals C. Given a list of cost of L flavors, output the indices of two items whose sum equals C.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains T, T test cases follow. 
Each test case follows the format: The first line contains C. The second line contains the number L. The third line contains L single space separated integers denoting the price of each flavor.

Output Format

Output two integers, each of which is a valid index of the flavor. The lower index must be printed first. Indices are indexed from 1 to L.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
10 ≤ C ≤ 10000 
1 ≤ L ≤ 10000

The prices of two items may be same and each test case has a unique solution.

Explanation

The sample input has two test cases. For the 1st, the amount C = 4 and there are 5 flavors at the store. The flavors indexed at 1 and 4 sums to 4. For the 2nd test case, the amount C = 4 and the flavors indexed at 1 and 2 sums to 4.
